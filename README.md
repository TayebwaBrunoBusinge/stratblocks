**From trading idea → backtest → insight in under 10 minutes.**

Stratblocks is a next-generation backtesting framework that turns natural language strategy descriptions into **modular, bulletproof strategy blocks**. Think of it as LEGO for trading systems — powered by AI and built for speed, clarity, and trust.

## 🚀 Why Stratblocks?

Every trader knows the pain:

- ⏳ Hours wasted writing boilerplate code.
- 🐛 Debugging fragile scripts that break on edge cases.
- 📊 Manual, repetitive parameter tuning.
- 🤯 Slow iteration that kills creativity.

Stratblocks eliminates all of that.

**Describe your strategy in plain English → AI assembles it into tested components → visualize and backtest instantly.**

## ✨ Core Principles

1. **Lego-Like Strategy Blocks**  
   - Every block = bulletproof, reusable logic (entries, exits, filters, risk, execution).  
   - Blocks snap together visually; no broken code paths.

2. **Explainable AI Assembly**  
   - Natural language → strategy graph.  
   - Transparent flow chart of how blocks connect (no “black box” surprises).

3. **Zero Debugging Headaches**  
   - Block-level integrity means you tweak connections, not code.  
   - Advanced users can create custom blocks while preserving robustness.

4. **Fast Validation Loop**  
   - Go from idea to validation in < 10 minutes.  
   - Standardized performance metrics (Sharpe, CAGR, Max Drawdown, Win Rate).  

5. **AI-Enhanced Insights**  
   - Backtest results are passed through AI analysis.  
   - AI suggests parameter adjustments aligned with your chosen metrics.
